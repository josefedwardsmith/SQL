# SQL

Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to work with relational databases using SQL to answer business questions. As part of a coursework brief, I was provided with a larger dataset and asked to write a range of SQL queries to extract meaningful insights. The focus of the project was on joining tables, selecting relevant fields, and structuring queries to return clear, usable results.

Dataset

The dataset consists of a relational database containing multiple linked tables. In the example demonstrated, the database includes:

Customers table – containing customer details such as first name and last name

Orders table – containing transactional data such as order ID and items purchased

The dataset was provided as part of coursework and designed to reflect a realistic business database structure.

Analysis Approach

To answer the required business questions, I wrote SQL queries that combined data across tables using appropriate join logic. In this example, I used an INNER JOIN to link customer records with their corresponding orders through a shared customer_id. This enabled customer information to be merged with transactional data in a single result set.

The queries were structured to:

Accurately join tables using primary and foreign keys

Select only relevant fields required for analysis

Order results for clarity and interpretability

Example Output

The resulting query output combines customer names with order details, demonstrating how relational data can be queried and structured to support analysis and reporting.
