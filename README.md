# SQL

Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to work with relational databases using SQL to answer business-focused questions. As part of a coursework brief, I was provided with a larger dataset and asked to write a range of SQL queries to extract meaningful information. The focus of the analysis was on joining tables, selecting relevant fields, and ordering results to produce clear and usable outputs.

Dataset

The project uses a relational database structure containing multiple linked tables. In the example shown, the database includes:

Customers table – storing customer details such as first name and last name

Orders table – storing transactional information such as order ID and items purchased

The dataset was provided as part of coursework and designed to reflect a realistic business database scenario.

Analysis Approach

To complete the brief, I wrote SQL queries that combined data across tables using appropriate join logic. In this example, an INNER JOIN was used to link customer records with their corresponding orders through a shared customer_id. This approach allowed customer information and order details to be returned in a single, structured result set.

The queries were designed to:

Join tables accurately using primary and foreign keys

Select only relevant fields required for analysis

Order results to improve clarity and interpretability

Example Output

The resulting output combines customer names with order details, demonstrating how SQL can be used to query relational databases effectively for analysis and reporting purposes.
